Hey nerd, not sure how you found my blog but here we are. Two weirdos staring eye to eye wondering what to say next. Well let me start.

I'm a nerd, a big. fucking. nerd. I guess that makes two of us if you're still reading this. Like every good ADHD kid, I tend to hyperfocus on stuff. But there's a catch, I'm a Jack of all trades but master of none. I start projects, learn enough to get dangerous and then toss it aside for the next cool thing. Does that make me a picture perfect zoomer? I'll let you be the judge :shrug:

Now I'm already hearing you screeching "but you gotta have _some_ specific interest?! You can't know a bit about _everything_!!!" and you'd be right. I currently tend to gravitate towards three "fields" in particular.

## Cybersecurity 

So I never really went to school for this. TL;DR, after some bad life choices, I ended up welding. More precisely, I was a sanitary stainless guy which meant I used to build and install medical, food and brewing equipement.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: stretch; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="/images/hospital-cart-washers.png" style="max-width: 33%; flex: 1; object-fit: contain; cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://www.steris.com')"/>
    <img src="images/fermenteur.png" style="max-width: 33%; flex: 1; object-fit: contain; cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open('https://www.ebrequipment.com/')"/>
    <img src="images/pipes.jpg" style="max-width: 33%; flex: 1; object-fit: contain;"/>
</div>

After working for roughly 7 years in that field, I quickly realised that my body would essentially be turned to mush if I kept on going. "But there's OSHA to protect you!!!", yeah right. Like your boss is gonna ask you to take care of your body when you're doing <a href="https://au.jora.com/blog/what-are-shutdown-jobs-and-how-to-get-one/">shutdown work</a> and every hour that passes costs your client $50k+.
